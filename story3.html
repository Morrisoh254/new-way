</section>

<!-- STORY CONTENT -->
<div class="story-container">
    <p class="story-intro">
    ✨ This is the story of <strong>David K.</strong> — a testimony of redemption, 
    restoration, and the light that overcomes darkness. 
    Read prayerfully and be encouraged.
</p>

    <p>
        
    First of all, I hope you are reading this from a large house with excellent Wi-Fi. If you are still buffering YouTube videos in 2026, then clearly something went wrong. We need to talk.
But what no one saw… was the war inside him.

Let me guess: you wake up early now? You jog? You drink water voluntarily? Incredible. Right now, I consider walking to the fridge a cardio session. Please tell me you’ve evolved beyond arguing with the snooze button every morning. That button and I are in a toxic relationship.

Secondly, I truly hope you finally became organized. As I write this, my desk looks like a crime scene. There are papers everywhere. I found a notebook I thought I lost in 2023. It was under another notebook that I thought I lost in 2024. If archaeologists dig up this room, they’ll think it’s layers of civilization.
    </p>

    <p>
        “I felt trapped,” he says. “I knew who I wanted to become, but I didn’t know how to become him.”
    </p>

    <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>

    <p>
       Now let’s discuss money. Dear Future Me, if you are wealthy, kindly remember your humble beginnings. Remember when you Googled “how to become rich without doing anything” and were deeply disappointed by the results? Remember when you transferred money and prayed louder than you ever have in church? Those were character-building moments.

If you are not rich yet, that’s fine — but at least tell me you stopped checking your account balance like it’s a live football score. “Maybe it increased in the last 10 minutes.” It never increases in 10 minutes. Never.

Speaking of football, I hope you finally learned to stop shouting at the TV as if the players can hear you. They cannot. They are in another country. They are not waiting for your tactical advice. You yelling “PASS THE BALL!” changes nothing — except your blood pressure.

Now let’s address food. Please tell me you learned to cook more than eggs. Currently, my cooking skills are limited to:he other day I tried to cook something “simple.” The smoke alarm responded like I was summoning dragons. If you can now cook a full meal without Googling every step, I am proud of you.

Also, have you stopped laughing at your own jokes? Because right now, I do. Frequently. Sometimes I tell a joke, nobody laughs, and I continue laughing alone. It’s not awkward at all. Absolutely not.he other day I tried to cook something “simple.” The smoke alarm responded like I was summoning dragons.

    <h2>Transformation</h2>

    <p>
       I hope you are still dreaming big. Right now, I have about 37 ideas written down. Half of them are brilliant. The other half were written at midnight and make no sense. One of them just says “create something revolutionary.” Very specific. Very helpful.

Did you finally learn patience? Because currently, I order something online and check the tracking number every 12 minutes. “Has it moved?” It left the warehouse 30 seconds ago. Relax.

Also, I sincerely hope you stopped saying, “I’ll start tomorrow.” Tomorrow is the most overbooked day in history. Diet starts tomorrow. Gym starts tomorrow. Saving money starts tomorrow. If tomorrow were a person, it would file a complaint for overwork.

Let’s talk about confidence. I hope you grew into someone bold. Someone who doesn’t overthink simple messages like: “Hey.” Right now, I rewrite texts like I’m submitting them for a literature award. Delete. Rewrite. Add emoji. Remove emoji. Panic. Send.

Oh, and please tell me you learned how to fold a fitted sheet. This has been my greatest enemy. I’m convinced fitted sheets were invented as a test of character. If you can fold one neatly, you deserve a trophy.

Most importantly, I hope you are happy. Not just “smiling-for-Instagram” happy. Real happy. The kind where you wake up with peace. The kind where you look back at this letter and laugh at how dramatic I was.
    </p>

    <p>
       And if you are reading this and thinking, “Wow, I was ridiculous,” remember — you needed this version of you. The one who tried. The one who failed. The one who laughed anyway.

So, Future Me, wherever you are — keep going. Keep building. Keep believing. And if you are rich… please send money back in time. I don’t know how that works, but figure it out. You’re the advanced version.
    </p>
