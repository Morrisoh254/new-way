    <p class="story-intro">
    ✨ This is the story of <strong>Michael A.</strong> — a testimony of redemption, 
    restoration, and the light that overcomes darkness. 
    Read prayerfully and be encouraged.
</p>

    <p>
        For most of his life, Michael looked like he had everything together.

He was disciplined. Focused. Intelligent. The kind of young man people trusted. The kind of son parents were proud of. The kind of friend others leaned on.

But what no one saw… was the war inside him.

Behind the achievements lived quiet battles — habits he could not break, thoughts he could not silence, and guilt he could not escape. Every time he promised himself, “This is the last time,” he would fall again.

        “I felt trapped,” he says. “I knew who I wanted to become, but I didn’t know how to become him.”
    </p>

    <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>

    <p>
        The turning point came during a quiet evening when everything he relied on collapsed.
        What seemed like failure became the doorway to surrender.
        For most of his life, Michael looked like he had everything together.

He was disciplined. Focused. Intelligent. The kind of young man people trusted. The kind of son parents were proud of. The kind of friend others leaned on.

    <h2>Transformation</h2>

    <p>
        Through community, discipline, and prayer, restoration began.
        Slowly, the chains loosened.
        Freedom did not come overnight — but it came faithfully.
        For most of his life, Michael looked like he had everything together.

        His story reminds us that no darkness is too deep for light to reach.
